# Case Study
The case study **"E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis"** involves working with a dataset of customer transactions from an e-commerce website, using various customer attributes and purchase history to analyze customer behavior. The objectives include applying decision tree and ensemble methods to derive meaningful business insights from data analysis

Tools Used in the case Study are :
1) SAAS Enterprise Miner
2) Talend Data Prep
3) Talend Data Integration

**SAS e-Miner:** The role of SAS e-Miner involves tasks such as data import, preprocessing, decision tree analysis, and ensemble methods application. It is used to create a decision tree model to analyze customer behavior and apply bagging and boosting using the Random Forest algorithm as a bagging example

**Talend Data Integration:** The Role of Talend Data Integration involes tasks Such data collection from the source, Transformation of the data collected and Loading and storing the data. In our Case Study we used it for data Merging and transformation.

**Talend Data Prep:** Its is used for data cleaning and preparation before importing the dataset into SAS Enterprise Miner

# Findings and Insights
